Everything about novel reader.

## Self-hosted Service

- [Calibre Web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web)
  - No offline support
  - Not e-ink friendly
  - Limited choice of source prodivers (Calibre and Kobo sync)
  - It is a self hosted product and comes with the hassle of maintenance.
  - Calibre for example doesn’t seem to do the multi device access/sync well
  - Calibre doesn't have a reader app as far as I can tell on android or iphone
- TaleBook
